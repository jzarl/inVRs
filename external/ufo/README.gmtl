Installing GMTL for use with ufo
================================

Prerequisites:
 - scons

1) Download GMTL
   The latest version can be found here:
   http://sourceforge.net/projects/ggt

2) Unpack GMTL and enter the gmtl-xxxx folder

3) Install GMTL to the ufo/external folder:
   scons install prefix=/path/to/ufo/external

   If using scons is not an option for you, just copying the include directory
   of GMTL to ufo/external/ should also work.

4) If the version you downloaded is still not found, or if you have already installed
   GMTL somewhere else, use one of these lines for cmake:

   # cd build
   # cmake .. -DGMTL_ROOT_DIR=/usr/local
   OR:
   # cmake .. -DGMTL_PROBE_VERSIONS=0.6.1-Alpha1
   OR:
   # cmake .. -DGMTL_PROBE_VERSIONS=0.6.1-Alpha1 -DGMTL_ROOT_DIR=/usr/local

Note: if support for inVRs is enabled, it is normally a good idea to use the
same GMTL version as the inVRs framework.
