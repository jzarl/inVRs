Compatibility scripts for CMake versions < 2.8.9
================================================

This directory contains standard cmake modules from version 2.8.9
that are not available in older versions of cmake (2.8.3-2.8.8).

WriteBasicConfigVersionFile.cmake is available in version 2.2.2
already, but it won't hurt to include it there.
