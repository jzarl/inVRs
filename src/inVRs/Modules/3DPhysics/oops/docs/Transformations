Transformations

ODEObject:
The transformation of the ODEObject is equal to the transformation of the dBodyID-object in the ODE simulation:

I) ODEObject.transformation = dBodyID.transformation

There are 2 further Transformations that are needed to match the transformation of the ODEObject to the transformation
of the visual representation:

OFFSET-TRANSFORMATION:
The offset-transformation is applied to the Entity's transformation to get the initial ODEObject-transformation so that
the shape of the ODEObject matches to the visual representation. This offset is entered in world coordinates, not in the
Entity's coordinate system!!!




Problems:

Problem: 	center of visual representation is not equal to center of ODEObject
Solution:	set offsetTransformation of ODEObject so that the visual representation matches to the ODEObject
